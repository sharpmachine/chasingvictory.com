Accept deposit payments for any product in your WooCommerce store then manage all follow payments and invoicing as well.

== Description ==

Woo Deposits allows you to accept deposits or partial payments on any WooCommerce product, product variation, composite product and more. You can increase sales by lowering the barrier to entry on mid- to high-end products. Layaway works for the major on-line retailers and now it can work for your WooCommerce store too.

Once the initial payment has been sent, your customers enter the follow up payment flow. From there you can manage invoicing, payment history and tracking and allow them to easily pay their remaining bill from the email invoice.
